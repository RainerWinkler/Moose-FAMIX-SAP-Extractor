Introduction and Goals
======================

Requirements Overview
---------------------
- Extract model information from a SAP system to be analyzed with Moose and Moose2Model.
- Provides where used informations over multiple levels.
- Provides informations what is used (Downsearch).

Quality Goals
-------------
- Easy to install
- Easy to upgrade
- Does not extract code (Potentially sensitive information shall not be extracted)
- Does not write into the system (Does not destabilize the system)
- Extracts an application that contains of about a view 1000 elements in a few minutes
- Is not able to handle an inconsistent Where Used Index of the extracted SAP system

Stakeholders
------------

.Stake Holders
|===
| Role/Name |Expectations  

|SAP Developer
|Get an overview of the coding elements, there dependences and links to simplify opening them in an editor

|Software Architect
|Get an overwiew of the coding elements. Have the opportunity to display dependencies on class and package level.

|System Owner
|Protect coding. Prevent the system from activities that might destabilize it.
|===



Architecture Constraints
========================
- Has to be easy to install in the analyzed system. A single report with texts should suffice.
- Does not write any information in the analyzed system.
- Uses only a file import to extract informations. Web Calls and other techniques are not allowed.

System Scope and Context
========================
Components of SAP2Moose. Contains also components to maintain, test and documentate (including images used to documentate).

.Explanation
|===
|Component |Explanation

|SAP2Moose (Global classes and report templates
|To simplify the development, SAP2Moose is developed using global classes

|Report to convert global to local classes to make a simple ABAP report
|This is the coding that converts global classes to local classes of the report that runs in the analyzed SAP system

|Github
|This contains sub components to explain better how texts and images of the documentation are maintained

|png file
|The information how the png file is build is part of the image file. This is an option when it is exported from draw.io. Open the file with draw.io to be able to edit it and include a copy of the diagram when you export it.

Solution Strategy
=================

.Solution Strategy
|===
|Challenge |Solution

|Install logic as a single report without making the development more complex
|Develop with global classes. Convert the coding to local classes of a single report before installation.

|The extractor shall run in older SAP releases
|Do not use modern ABAP statements in the main logic. Use modern in unit tests and supporting code as these are not part of the single report that runs in the analyzed system

|The extractor shall be fast and reliable
|Do not use SAP method and functions to read code components and where used information. Reading the database tables is faster and more robust.

Building Block View
===================
The following diagram visualizes the main components that are called when an extraction is done.

Glossary
========


.Glossary
|===
| Term |Explanation

|Down Search
|Search for what an element is using. This is currently not supported in the Where Used function of SAP.

|Up Search
|This is similar to the Where Used function of SAP. Not all is found as in Where Used. On the other hand interfaces, redefinitions and dynamic usages may be found in an Up Search of SAP2Moose
